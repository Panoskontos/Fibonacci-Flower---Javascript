It all Started With a Pair of Rabbits
The Fibonacci sequence was born out of a simple, hypothetical puzzle about rabbit population:

A man asked, “If two rabbits were put in a fenced yard, how many pairs of rabbits will they produce in a year?
Rabbits can’t reproduce until they are one month old. So in the first month, the same pair remains. In the second month, the female gives birth to a pair of rabbits. In the third month, the original pair produces another pair of newborn, while their offspring grow to adulthood. This pattern continues and follows 1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55, 89, 144 sequence which goes onto infinity.

While initially, Fibonacci’s experiment looked like a hypothetical situation, the sequence eventually appeared in almost all forms of life, including human beings and has been keeping the scientists fascinated for centuries.
